// There is a built -in method called “setTimeout”, which calls a function after 
// a given period of time.

// So here, the myMessage function will execute   after 5 seconds.
// (1 second = 1000 milliseconds).

// In other words, the myMessage function is being called after
// something happened  (after 5 seconds passed for this example),
// but not before.So, the myMessage function is an example of a callback function.
